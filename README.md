# Cinema-Tickets

#This is where I had to build a Programme using Java to be able to select different cinema tickets and show the total at the bottom. This was all created with BlueJay and Java where I used J-Frames to set up the GUI.

#To run this programme you would need the following:

#BlueJay
#Java JDK or JRE

Once downloaded double click on jar file to run it.
